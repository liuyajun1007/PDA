# MRDPDA: a multi-Laplacian regularized deepFM model for predicting piRNA-disease associations
PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a kind of important small non-coding RNAs and play a vital role in maintaining the stability of genome. Previous studies have revealed that piRNAs are  potential biomarkers and therapy targets of various diseases. Existing computational models face the challenge in capturing piRNA-disease associations from limited data. In this study, we propose a novel method, MRDPDA, for predicting piRNA-disease associations based on limited data from multiple sources. Speficifically, MRDPDA effectively integrates a deep factorization machine (deepFM) model with regularizations of several seperate Laplacians calculated from multiple yet limited datasets, instead of simply calculating an average similarity network to regularize the deepFM. Moreover, we propose a unified objective function to combine embedding loss about similarities to ensure that the embedding is suitable for the prediction task. In addition, reliable negative samples are created from the unlabeled dataset with a deep autoencoder. Compared with two latest methods, MRDPDA achieves the best performance on the pirpheno dataset in terms of the five-fold cross validation test and independent test set, and case studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of MRDPDA.
